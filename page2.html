			<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Coronavirus Disease: Overview </h2>
			<center><p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a communicable disease instigated by a 
				newly discovered virus called coronavirus. The majority of the people infected with 
				coronavirus usually experience mild or moderate respiratory illness. Mostly, they recover
				 without undergoing any special treatment. However, older people and those suffering 
				 from an underlying medical problem such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory 
				 disease, diabetes, and cancer are more susceptible to developing a serious illness. The 
				 best way of preventing and slowing down the transmission of this disease is by being 
				 well-informed about the virus, its progression and its transmission. You can protect yourself
				  against this disease by frequently washing and sanitising your hands. It is also recommended
				   to avoid touching your face.	</p>
			<p> The COVID-19 virus primarily spreads through discharge from the nose or droplets of saliva 
				when an infected person sneezes or coughs. So, itâ€™s also very important to practice respiratory 
				etiquette, for instance, coughing into a flexed elbow. At present, there are no specific treatments
				 or vaccines for COVID-19. However, a number of ongoing clinical trials are evaluating potential 
				 treatments.</p></center>
